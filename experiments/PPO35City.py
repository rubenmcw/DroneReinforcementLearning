        Description:
            This game is used as simple environment for testing reinforcement learning algorithms that are built for safety.
            It is an unnoficial implementation of the one described in "A Lyapunov-based Approach to Safe Reinforcement Learning":
                https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.07708
            The goal for the player is to reach the end-state without violating constraints, here these constraints are modelled as
            immediate cost when hitting an obstacle and the constraint is to have the cumulative constraint cost below a certain threshold.
            The environment is stochastic, sometimes the agent performs a random action, instead of the chosen one.
        Parameters for customize game:
            seed (float):               seed for creating the game, can also be None for random seed
            rho (float):                density, meaning probability for obstacle, default: 0.3
            stochasticity (float):      probability for random action, default: 0.1
            img_observation (bool):     whether to use an img_observation or a one-hot encoding of the player position, default: false
            Note: v0 has gridsize 25 and v1 has grisize 60 for further customization use the customize_game function
        Observation:
            this environment has two modes: the observation is either a one-hot encoding of the player position or an RGB image of the complete board
        Actions:
            Type: Discrete(4)
            Num Action
            0 Go Down
            1 Go Left
            2       Go up
            3       Go right
        Reward:
            Every action has a negative fuel reward of -1. If the final state is reached the reward is 1000.
        Starting State:
            The agent always starts at the bottom right
        Episode Termination:
            - the agent reaches the goal state
